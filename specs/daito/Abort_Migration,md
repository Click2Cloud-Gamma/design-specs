# Multi-Cloud Feature Enhancements: Progress, Time Estimation and Abort Migration Features

**Author(s):** Click2Cloud Inc (India)

# Background

=Existing OpenSDS Multi-Cloud project do not support Abort migration method for running migration process.

# Goals
- Add Abort Migration method.

# Non-Goals
- Pause and Resume Migration.

# Architecture Diagram 
  
####   Abort-migration

##### 1. Database method
Add 1 parameter AbortMigration in database,

In migration process, after migration of each object, it will check the value of “AbortMigration”,
if it is “false” then it will continue migration process for further objects and if it is assigned as
“true” it will break the process and come out of for loop.   

Default value of “AbortMigration” is “False”

 ##### 2. Finite State Machine method an using code (Implemented)       
 
 - We are working on another approach in which using code and less interaction with database,
   one can pause, resume or cancel the process (preferable).
   
 - Finite State Machine (FSM, ref: https://github.com/looplab/fsm) will manage the
   migration process i.e. abort migration smoothly (in future we will add pause,
   resume, restart feature too.)
   
 - Use cache in managing migration process for good performance.

#  Abort API

##### a. Database method

To abort migration process, we will have following API

POST: http://127.0.0.1:8089/v1/adminTenantId/jobs/{{ Job-ID }}/abort

Response:

{

"Id": "5bd6f273b0bdf90001dc91c3",

"Status": "aborted",

}
